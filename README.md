## Gubbin
Gubbin are small doodads that sometimes serve a purpose despite their simplicity.

Relax - these particular gubbin are of the CouchDB variety.
-  couch-feeds /kouCH-fēdʒ/ - is for accessing, listening to (or not, as the case may be), and the manipulating of either the _changes or the _externals feeds of CouchDB.
-  couch-? - give me an idea for another couch-gubbin.
