`gubbins' /ˈgʌbɪnz/ - derived from the Latin gubbinulus - which is a term to loosely describe things or stuff. It's just things that don't really have that much of a purpose.

For example:

-  God on his thoughts about Gubbins
  -  “If I had a gubbins, I'd gubbins in the morning, I'd gubbins in the evening, all over this land”
-  Oscar Wilde on gubbins
  -  “Gubbins? You can't handle the gubbins!”
-  Hamlet on gubbins
  -  “To gubbins, or not to gubbins? That is the question...”

You see, gubbins as a whole are definitely not something to be trifled with. They could be anything. Even gubbins of mass destruction! That's right! Terrorists could be next door brewing gubbins right now! Even so, gubbins could be the food of the baby mernimbler, which would be the softer bits of clouds.

### Current and future couch-gubbins
Relax - these particular gubbins are of the CouchDB variety.
-  couch-feeds /kouCH-fēdʒ/ - is for accessing, listening to (or not, as the case may be), and the manipulating of either the _changes or the _externals feeds of CouchDB.
-  couch-express /kouCH-ikˈspres/ - is an email send/receive gubbin; couch-feeds makes use of it in it's primary use case.
-  couch-? /kouCH-?/ - give me a snazzy idea for the next couch-gubbin.

### Other types of gubbins
Honestly, I haven't thought too hard about it...
